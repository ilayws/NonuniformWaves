# Wave propagation through non uniform mediums - Python simulation

Simulates a 1D wave (on a string) using a discrete expression of the wave equation. The wave velocity along the string c(x) can vary to simualte a non-uniform medium (e.g varying string density). The wave is then analyzed using FFT and Hilbert transform for instantenous frequencies
